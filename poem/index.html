        <h1>Your Best</h1>
         <p>If you always try your best Then you'll never have to wonder About what you could have done If you'd summoned
            all your thunder. <br>
            And if your best Was not as good As you hoped it would be, You still could say, "I gave today All that I had
            in me."</p>
