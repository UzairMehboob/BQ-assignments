BEST BALOCHI CHICKEN SAJJI AT HOME
 Jump to Recipe  Print Recipe
I have made this Balochi chicken Sajji at least 30 times before I was confident enough to share the best version with you all! For those of you who don’t know, Sajji is a popular dish from the Balochistan province of Pakistan. It is popularly made with whole lamb or chicken, or big pieces of lamb or goat (like the leg of a goat). These whole lambs, chickens etc are attached to skewers, marinated in simple spices and roasted over coals. They are sometimes even stuffed with rice. It is the brown equivalent of a standard rotisserie chicken. The Sajji turns out juicy and moist from the inside with a crisp skin on top!

And even though, conventionally Sajji is made in an open fire, you can still make a kickass sajji in your own homes! All you need is an oven, some marinade and the will to make it! In this post I am going to tackle Chicken Sajji, and hopefully put up a post for lamb sajji soon!
